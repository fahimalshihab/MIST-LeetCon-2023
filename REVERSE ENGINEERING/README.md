# RED CODE
I accidentally installed a malicious package, "sqlmaps," instead of "sqlmap." It corrupted all of my pictures and is now demanding payment to restore them. I also discovered that a screenshot of my crypto wallet's seed phrase is among the affected files, and I can't remember the phrase.

I heard that you're skilled in reverse engineering and I need your help to recover the screenshot without paying the attacker. Your task is to reverse engineer the malicious package and recover the screenshot.

I'll provide my bash history and the unreadable screenshot of the seed phrase.
